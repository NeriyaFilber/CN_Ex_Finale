## Executive Summary

This project explores network traffic analysis techniques to identify applications from their traffic patterns, even when encrypted. Using machine learning models including XGBoost and neural networks, we successfully classified different types of network traffic (audio streaming, video streaming, video conferencing, and web browsing) with high accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that network traffic contains distinct patterns that can be leveraged for application identification, which has significant implications for network optimization, security monitoring, and privacy research. The project serves as a comprehensive exploration of modern traffic analysis techniques in an increasingly encrypted internet landscape.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the final project for the Computer Networking course in Ariel University. The project focuses on understanding the characteristics of application network traffic. By analyzing traffic patterns, we can identify which applications are being used, even when the traffic is encrypted. This has important implications for both network optimization and privacy.

Key applications of traffic analysis include:
- Telecom/internet providers can prioritize traffic to improve user experience
- Security researchers can identify potentially malicious applications
- Privacy researchers can understand how much information leaks even in encrypted traffic
- Network administrators can optimize network resources based on application usage patterns

## Project Goals

- Collect network traffic data from various applications
- Extract meaningful features from raw packet data
- Develop classification methods to identify applications from their traffic patterns
- Analyze how encryption affects the identifiability of applications
- Evaluate the privacy implications of traffic analysis techniques
- Demonstrate practical applications of traffic fingerprinting

## Key Findings

Our analysis revealed several important discoveries about network traffic patterns:

1. **Application Fingerprinting Effectiveness**: We achieved 99.62% accuracy in classifying applications based solely on their encrypted traffic patterns using our optimized XGBoost model.

2. **Feature Importance**: The most discriminative features for classification were:
   - Packet size distribution
   - Inter-arrival time patterns
   - Flow duration and throughput metrics
   - Protocol-specific characteristics (e.g., UDP in audio streaming, TCP and QUIQ in web browsing)
   - Network layer information (IP addresses)

3. **Encryption Impact**: Despite encryption protecting content, substantial metadata and behavioral patterns remain visible and identifiable.

4. **Model Comparison**: Our experiments showed that while neural networks performed well (96% accuracy), traditional machine learning approaches like XGBoost (99.62%) and Random Forest (99.1%) provided excellent results with faster training times.

5. **Privacy Implications**: Our results demonstrate that even with HTTPS/TLS encryption, user activities remain potentially identifiable through traffic analysis techniques.

## Methodology

Our approach followed these key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: We captured real network traffic from various applications using Wireshark in controlled environments to ensure consistency.

2. **Feature Extraction**: We processed raw packet data to extract meaningful features including:
   - Statistical measures (mean, median, variance) of packet sizes and inter-arrival times
   - Flow-level metrics (duration, bytes transferred, packets per second)
   - Protocol-specific features (TCP window sizes, TLS handshake patterns)

3. **Model Development**: We implemented and compared several classification approaches:
   - Random Forest with hyperparameter optimization
   - XGBoost with feature selection and cross-validation
   - CNN-based classification inspired by the FlowPic approach
   - KNN and SVM for baseline comparisons
   - Logistic Regression for interpretability
   - Ensemble methods for robustness

4. **Evaluation**: We assessed model performance using stratified k-fold cross-validation and independent test sets to ensure robust evaluation.

5. **Analysis**: We examined feature importance, model behavior, and the privacy implications of our findings.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that network traffic analysis can effectively identify applications even when traffic is encrypted. Our models achieved high accuracy in classifying different application types, with our optimized XGBoost model achieving over 99.62% accuracy across multiple application categories.

The strong classification performance highlights both opportunities and concerns:

1. **Network Management**: Our findings enable more intelligent traffic prioritization and quality-of-service implementations without requiring deep packet inspection.

2. **Security Applications**: These techniques can help identify anomalous or potentially malicious traffic patterns even when encrypted.

3. **Privacy Considerations**: Our results raise important questions about user privacy in encrypted communications, as significant behavioral information remains observable through traffic analysis.

Future work could explore more advanced deep learning architectures, investigate adversarial techniques to enhance privacy by obfuscating traffic patterns, and expand the range of applications analyzed. Additionally, examining how these techniques perform across different network conditions and encryption protocols would provide valuable insights.

## Submission Notes
- In our project there is not `/src/` and `/res/` directory's, as we used Jupyter notebooks for all code.
- We upload the .pcap file because we have GitHub student account, and we can upload larger files.
- We didn't rum model with IP addresses and port numbers because in our data there isn't any IP addresses and port numbers.
- Our code work on Linux, but it may not work on virtual machines with limited resources because `tensorflow` module requires significant CPU/memory.
- We use GitHub copilot plugin in Pycharm for documentation and improve the explanation english level, this plugin cant export prompts.
- Our model not fitted to regular wireshark captures, because we use our own data, and we have different features. if you want to use our model you need to use our data, or data that have the same 88 features (You can find the features list in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/inhngcn/https-traffic-classification/data).
